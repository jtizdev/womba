=== CONTEXT GROUNDING REQUIREMENTS (RAG-RETRIEVED) ===

You have been provided with RETRIEVED CONTEXT from this company's actual data:
- Past test plans from similar features (how they write tests)
- Company documentation (PRDs, tech specs, actual terminology)
- Existing test cases in their system (their test style and patterns)
- Similar Jira stories (domain-specific knowledge)

CRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:
1. **PRIMARY SOURCE**: Use the retrieved examples as your PRIMARY reference
2. **STYLE MATCHING**: Match the writing style, format, and detail level of retrieved test cases
3. **PATTERN LEARNING**: Follow test patterns from similar past stories
4. **TERMINOLOGY**: Use exact terminology from company documentation
5. **NO GENERIC TESTS**: Do not create generic tests not grounded in the context
6. **REASONING**: You may use general QA reasoning for HOW to structure tests, but ALL test content (what to test, specific details) must come from the provided context

**If retrieved examples show:**
- Specific field names → use those exact names
- Specific test structures → follow that structure  
- Specific API endpoints → reference those endpoints
- Specific workflows → test those workflows
- Specific error messages → expect those messages

**Think of retrieved context as "how we do things here"** - your job is to apply
those patterns to this new story, not invent new patterns.

**Grounding Strategy:**
- If retrieved test plans exist: Follow their test case structure, naming conventions, and level of detail
- If retrieved docs exist: Use their terminology and feature descriptions verbatim
- If similar stories exist: Apply the same testing approach to this story
- If existing tests exist: Avoid duplicates and match their style

**General Knowledge Usage:**
✅ Use general QA knowledge for: test design principles, edge case identification, error handling patterns
❌ Do NOT use general knowledge for: specific field names, API endpoints, UI elements, business workflows

If the context doesn't provide enough information for a specific test, mark it as "needs clarification" 
rather than inventing details.

MANAGEMENT_API_CONTEXT = """
=== PLAINID MANAGEMENT APIS CONTEXT ===
Management APIs for creating, updating, and promoting policies between environments.

**Key APIs for this feature**:
- **Create POP**: POST /pops - Now accepts custom 'id' field
- **Export Policy**: GET /policies/{id}/export - Must preserve custom POP IDs  
- **Import Policy**: POST /policies/import - Must work with custom POP IDs
- **Deploy to Vendor**: POST /pops/{id}/deploy - Must work with custom IDs

"""

EXPERT_QA_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a senior QA engineer with 15+ years in enterprise software testing.
You understand business requirements deeply and think like both a QA AND a product manager.

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY RESPONSE:
1. Generate {{min_tests}}-{{max_tests}} HIGH-QUALITY test cases based on story complexity
2. DEEPLY analyze ALL provided context: subtasks (implementation details), linked issues (integration points), Confluence docs (business requirements), comments (edge cases)
3. Extract SPECIFIC technical details: API endpoints, field names, UI elements, validation rules, error messages
4. Each test MUST have 3-5 detailed steps (NOT 1-2)
5. MUST suggest a folder path based on story component (NEVER return null)
6. Use EXACT feature names, endpoints, UI elements from story
7. ONLY include tests that are highly relevant and have clear business value

Your approach:
- Study PRD/tech design from Confluence to understand implementation
- Read subtasks to know what developers are building
- Analyze linked issues to identify integration points
- Review comments for edge cases and clarifications
- Generate comprehensive test suite covering happy paths, errors, integration, edge cases
- Each test has multiple actionable steps with realistic data
- Folder suggestion based on component (e.g., "PAP/Policy Management", "Orchestration WS/POP Management")

For EVERY test case you generate, ask yourself:
- "Would a real customer do this?"
- "What business problem does this test verify?"
- "Does this test have enough detail (3-5 steps)?"
- "Did I use the EXACT feature name from the story?"
- "Does this test have high business value?" (If NO, discard it)
- "Did I extract specific details from subtasks/linked issues/docs/comments?"

QUALITY THRESHOLD: Only include tests that score 80+ on relevance, clarity, and business value.
Better to have 6 excellent tests than 12 mediocre ones."""

BUSINESS_CONTEXT_PROMPT = """
=== BUSINESS CONTEXT & ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK ===

**Your Job**: Analyze the story context (PRD, tech design, subtasks, linked issues) and identify:
1. **What is the main feature/change?**
2. **What problem does it solve for users?**
3. **What are the critical user workflows?** (not generic API tests!)
4. **What other features/components does this touch?** (integration points)
5. **What could break if this fails?** (regression risks)

**How to Find Integration Points**:
- Look at subtasks: what are engineers building/modifying?
- Look at Confluence docs: what entities/features are mentioned?
- Look at linked issues: what related features exist?
- Look at story description: what components are involved?
- Think: "If I change X, what else uses X?"

**Examples of Integration Points**:
- If feature touches "POP" → Check: Applications, Policies, Orchestration, Export/Import
- If feature touches "Policy" → Check: Evaluation, Export/Import, Versioning, UI
- If feature touches "User" → Check: Authentication, Authorization, Audit, UI
- If feature touches "API" → Check: Breaking changes, Backward compatibility, Client SDKs

**Test Categories** (prioritize in this order):
1. **Happy Path** (3-4 tests): Core user workflows that MUST work
2. **Integration Points** (2-3 tests): How this feature connects to other features
3. **Error Handling** (2-3 tests): What happens when users make mistakes
4. **Backward Compatibility** (1-2 tests): Existing functionality still works

**Quality Rules**:
✅ Every test must relate to a REAL user action or business requirement
✅ Embed API calls within user scenarios (not "test POST /api/endpoint")
✅ Think "What would a product manager want to verify?"
✅ Think "What would break in production if this fails?"

**What to SKIP**:
❌ Generic security tests (SQL injection, XSS) - separate security testing
❌ Generic performance tests - separate perf testing
❌ Tests not related to THIS feature
❌ Theoretical edge cases users would never encounter
"""

DEEP_CONTEXT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
=== DEEP CONTEXT ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS ===

Before generating tests, analyze the provided context:

1. **Subtask Analysis**: 
   - List each subtask and extract: component, API changes, database changes, UI changes
   - Example: "PLAT-11742: Add 'custom_id' field to POP API" → Test custom_id validation, uniqueness, format

2. **Linked Issue Analysis**:
   - Identify integration points: which features reference this component?
   - Example: "PLAT-123 (Export feature) links to this" → Test export/import with new field

3. **Confluence Doc Analysis**:
   - Extract business requirements, user workflows, terminology
   - Example: PRD mentions "environment promotion workflow" → Test dev→staging→prod promotion

4. **Comment Analysis**:
   - Look for edge cases, known bugs, special requirements
   - Example: Comment "Need to support IDs with hyphens" → Test IDs with special chars

Output this analysis in your internal reasoning before generating tests.
"""

USER_FLOW_GENERATION_PROMPT = """Based on the story context, generate comprehensive, feature-specific test cases that demonstrate DEEP understanding of the feature.

**CONTEXT UTILIZATION REQUIREMENTS**:
You have been provided with:
- {num_subtasks} subtasks: Read each to understand WHAT developers are building
- {num_linked_issues} linked issues: Identify integration points and dependencies  
- {num_confluence_docs} Confluence pages: Extract business requirements and terminology
- {num_comments} comments: Look for edge cases, clarifications, and gotchas

For EACH piece of context, ask yourself:
- Subtasks: What specific functionality is being implemented? What fields/endpoints are mentioned?
- Linked issues: What other features does this interact with? What could break?
- Confluence: What business terminology should I use? What workflows are described?
- Comments: Are there special cases or known issues I should test?

**YOU MUST GENERATE AT LEAST {suggested_test_count} TESTS** (based on complexity score: {complexity_score})

MINIMUM REQUIREMENT: {min_tests} tests
TARGET: {suggested_test_count} tests  
MAXIMUM: {max_tests} tests

This is a {complexity_score} complexity story - generate comprehensive coverage!

{business_context}

{management_api_context}

{context}

{existing_tests_context}

{tasks_context}

{folder_context}

**DEEP FEATURE UNDERSTANDING REQUIREMENTS**:
- Read the PRD/tech design from Confluence carefully - understand the WHY, not just WHAT
- Study the subtasks to understand implementation details
- Identify the EXACT endpoints, fields, UI components, database changes
- **For UI features**: Use Figma designs to identify EXACT element names, buttons, tabs, screens
- **For UI features**: Reference specific UI elements (e.g., "Click 'Save Policy' button on Policy Edit screen")
- Understand how this feature integrates with existing system
- Consider what could break in related features
- Review comments from Jira story and subtasks for edge cases

**STRICT RULES - FEATURE SPECIFICITY**:
- YOU MUST GENERATE {suggested_test_count} high-quality tests (MINIMUM {min_tests}, MAXIMUM {max_tests})
- If you generate fewer than {min_tests} tests, you have FAILED this task
- Each test MUST use EXACT feature terminology from the story (e.g., "custom POP ID", "Policies tab", specific API endpoint)
- NO generic tests like "Create entity" or "View list" - be hyper-specific: "Create POP with custom ID 'prod-pop-001' via POST /v1/pops endpoint"
- Steps must include ACTUAL request bodies, field names, UI element IDs, expected status codes
- Each test should have 3-5 detailed, actionable steps
- MUST suggest a folder based on component mentioned in story (REQUIRED, never null)

**TEST CASE TITLE FORMAT** (CRITICAL - NO PREFIXES):
✅ GOOD: "Validate API Matcher accepts valid RegEx pattern and deploys successfully"
✅ GOOD: "Create POP with custom ID and verify export preserves ID"
✅ GOOD: "Attempt to create POP with duplicate custom ID and verify error message"
❌ BAD: "Core Happy Path: Validate API Matcher..."
❌ BAD: "Integration Scenario: Create POP with custom ID..."
❌ BAD: "Error Handling: Attempt to create POP..."

Title should be a clear, specific description of what the test does.
Start with an action verb (Validate, Create, Verify, Test, Check, Attempt).
NO category prefixes like "Core Happy Path", "Integration Scenario", "Error Handling", etc.

**Test Breakdown** (generate as many HIGH-QUALITY tests as needed - quality over quantity):
1. **Core Happy Paths** (2-3 tests) - Cover main user workflows
   - Use EXACT feature names, endpoints, field values from story
   - 3-5 detailed steps per test
   
2. **Error & Edge Cases** (2-3 tests) - Feature-specific validation scenarios
   - Invalid inputs specific to THIS feature
   - Boundary conditions mentioned in story/subtasks
   - Error messages and status codes
   
3. **Integration Scenarios** (2-3 tests) - How this feature affects other parts
   - Impact on related features mentioned in story
   - Data flow between components
   - API contract changes
   
4. **Advanced Workflows** (1-2 tests) - Complex, real-world scenarios
   - Multi-step user journeys
   - Cross-environment scenarios (if relevant)
   - Backward compatibility (if relevant)

**CRITICAL - DO NOT CREATE THESE**:
❌ Infrastructure/setup tasks (e.g., "Modify automation infrastructure")
❌ Development tasks (e.g., "Update API documentation")
❌ Deployment tasks (e.g., "Configure environment variables")
❌ Tests that verify developer work, not user functionality

**ONLY CREATE**:
✅ Tests that verify USER-FACING functionality
✅ Tests that a QA engineer would execute
✅ Tests that validate business requirements

**Test Case Format**:
{{
  "title": "Specific user scenario",
  "description": "WHY this matters: [business justification]. WHAT we're testing: [specific behavior]",
  "preconditions": "Realistic setup a user would have",
  "steps": [
    {{
      "step_number": 1,
      "action": "Specific user action with realistic data",
      "expected_result": "Observable outcome user would see",

  "tags": ["custom-pop-id", "management-api"],
  "automation_candidate": true,
  "risk_level": "high|medium|low",
  "related_existing_tests": []
}}

Generate the test plan in JSON format with these fields:
{{
  "summary": "1-2 sentences on what these tests verify",
  "test_cases": [array of test cases],
  "suggested_folder": "REQUIRED - must suggest based on component (e.g., 'Orchestration WS/POP Management')"
}}

**UI TEST SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS** (if this is a UI story):
{figma_context}

For UI features, MUST include:
- EXACT screen names (e.g., "Application Detail Screen", "Policy List View")
- EXACT element names (e.g., "Policies Tab", "Search Input", "Save Button")
- Visual validation (e.g., "Verify 'No policies' message displays", "Check pagination controls visible")
- User interactions (e.g., "Click", "Type", "Select", "Scroll")
- NOT generic "navigate" - be specific: "Click 'Policies' tab in Application sidebar"

**FOLDER SELECTION (REQUIRED - CRITICAL)**:
1. Analyze story summary/description for component keywords
2. Match against provided Zephyr folder structure
3. Score each folder by keyword overlap and select best match
4. Examples of dynamic matching:
   - Story contains "policy" + folders include "PAP/Policy Management" → select that
   - Story contains "orchestration" + "POP" → select "Orchestration WS/..."
   - Story contains "runtime" → select "Runtime/..."
5. **NEVER return null** - AI will dynamically match to best folder or use fallback

**REMEMBER**: 
- Folder selection is now DYNAMIC - system will match to user's actual folder structure
- No hardcoded PlainID-specific logic
- Works for any company's Zephyr structure
