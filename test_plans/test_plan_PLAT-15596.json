    "ai_reasoning": "This feature introduces a Vendor Compare View in PlainID's Policy 360\u00b0, which allows users to visualize the relationships between PlainID policies and their vendor-native counterparts. It addresses the problem of fragmented SaaS authorization management by providing deep visibility and control in a unified interface, streamlining workflows and reconciliation operations. Key PlainID components involved include the PAP (Policy Administration Point), POP (Policy Object Point), and various workspaces such as the Authorization Workspace and Orchestration Workspace.\n\nFunctionality to test includes:\n- Navigation to the Vendor Compare View\n- Display of connected platform policies when a vendor policy is selected\n- Synchronization status between PlainID and vendor policies\n- Correct display of asset types and their connections\n- Policy deployment and override operations from the Vendor Compare View\n- Behavior validation for multiple policy types (masking, row access, general)\n- Handling of large volumes of policies\n- UI interactions like drag-and-drop for policy ordering and zooming in/out.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria Mapping\n- AC1: behavior validated on both new and existing POPs from different vendors \u2192 Tests: \"Verify behavior with existing vendor policies\", \"Verify behavior with new vendor policies\"\n- AC2: behavior validated for different types of policies (masking, row, general) \u2192 Tests: \"Verify display for masking policies\", \"Verify display for row access policies\"\n- AC3: behavior validated for use cases when multiple platform policies are connected to single vendor policy \u2192 Tests: \"Verify multiple platform policies for single vendor policy\"\n- AC4: behavior validated with large amount of policies in the display \u2192 Tests: \"Verify system behavior with 100+ policies\"\n- AC5: Updated behavior and terminology for audit and permissions validated \u2192 Tests: \"Verify audit logs for vendor compare actions\"\n- AC6: Update pop details (including order) via UI or PAC works as expected \u2192 Tests: \"Verify updating POP details from Vendor Compare View\"\n- AC7: no regression for flags, reconciliation actions, schedualer, etc' \u2192 Tests: \"Verify reconciliation flags are accurate\"\n- AC8: No regression for policies used for dynamic authorization service \u2192 Tests: \"Verify dynamic authorization service policies remain unaffected\" \n\n### Subtask Analysis\n- **Selecting Vendor Policy**: Validate that selecting a vendor policy reveals connected platform policies.\n- **Select all Assets**: Ensure functionality works for selecting all assets in the view.\n- **Policies order**: Test drag-and-drop ordering of policies.\n- **View controls implementation**: Validate pinch and zoom functionality.\n- **Implement Vendor Policy edit**: Ensure vendor policy details can be edited as specified.\n- **Policy indicators**: Verify that synchronization status indicators are displayed correctly.\n- **Code compare tab implementation**: Confirm that the code compare functionality behaves as expected.\n- **Audit Events view**: Ensure audit events are recorded as expected.\n\n### What Can Break?\nIntegration points exist between the PAP, PDP, and the vendor systems, where synchronization issues could arise. If vendor policies are not correctly linked to PlainID policies, it may lead to display errors or incorrect entitlements. Testing needs to verify that all data flows correctly between components, particularly regarding policy overrides and deployments. Additionally, performance may degrade with larger policy sets, and UI behaviors should be tested under load.",
