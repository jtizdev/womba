    "ai_reasoning": "1. **FEATURE ANALYSIS**: The user-facing change involves adding the full path for tables/views to the right panel in the POP interface, which improves user clarity when navigating data structures. Acceptance criteria likely focus on ensuring the full path is displayed correctly and consistently across various data interactions. \n\n2. **CONTEXT REVIEW**: Similar past stories indicate a focus on UI enhancements and data presentation. The terminology and detail level should align with previous test cases, particularly around the right panel functionality in the POP application.\n\n3. **COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT & TEST COUNT DECISION**: Given the change is medium priority and involves UI elements, I anticipate it affecting user interactions directly. The addition of full paths could have multiple integration points, such as correct data retrieval from databases and accurate representation in the UI. Therefore, I estimate between 8-12 tests would be robust enough to cover key workflows and potential edge cases, ensuring we capture any critical issues that might arise in production while not overloading with unnecessary tests.\n\n4. **TEST STRATEGY**: Core workflows must ensure that the full path is displayed correctly under normal circumstances. Integration tests will focus on interactions with the data layer and UI rendering. Error handling could involve testing scenarios where data retrieval fails or where incorrect data formats might be returned. \n\n5. **VALIDATION CHECK**: Each test will be evaluated to ensure it aligns with the specified requirements, terminology from company docs, and specific scenarios related to this feature enhancement. \n\nThe test cases generated are designed to cover all stated requirements comprehensively, providing clear value and ensuring we have no critical gaps in testing coverage.",
